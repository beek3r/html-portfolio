<h1>Film Favorites (per the brain of Brix)</h1>
<h2>A short list of some of my all-time favorite films.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Donnie Darko</h3>
<p>This is my favorite film of all time. I enjoy the dark cinematics/visuals and the plot twists.</p>
<h3>The Riddick Trilogy</h3>
<p>Okay, it's more than one film. But I'm a sucker for the action and sci-fi aspects.</p>
<h3>The first 3 Rambo films</h3>
<p>Again, more than one film. Hollywood magic aside, the action is great and I love the survival aspects.</p>
<h3>Shutter Island</h3>
<p>Kept me on my toes the entire ride. I loved the suspense.</p>
